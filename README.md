# Cyphers

## What is this project about
Despite being a software engineer, I have always had an interest in cybersecurity. This field is more like a side project for me. To better understand this field, I have chosen to better understand the significance of cyphers and try to replicate some of the encryption and decryption patterns that are used today in an easy to use command line user interface.

## What did I learn from this project
1. Gained better debugging skills (It was such a pain to figure out what went wrong when I got the wrong encryptions and decryptions)
2. Deeper knowledge regarding the importance of encrypting data and the complexity of each one.
3. Using hashmaps (Never used them before in a significant project)


## Future plans for this project?
1. Do the same project in Java.
2. Convert this to a GUI
3. Add more types such as Playfair and hills
